The Future of discord.py
--------------------------





Installing
----------

**Python 3.8 or higher is required**

To install the library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:

.. code:: sh

    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py openpyxl datetime

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py openpyxl datetime

now that we have installed the right libraries we just need to do a couple things more:

1. install git
.. code:: sh
   # debian based distos
   sudo apt-get install git
   
   #arch based distros
   sudo pacman -S git
   
   #the rest ???
